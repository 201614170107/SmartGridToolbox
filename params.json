{"name":"SmartGridToolbox","tagline":"Microgrid and Smart Grid Simulation","body":"### Introduction\r\nSmartGridToolbox is a C++-11 library API for developing smart grid and microgrid simulations. It was developed by the [Energy Systems](http://org.nicta.com.au/portfolio/energy-systems/) subgroup of [Nicta](http://www.nicta.com.au)'s [Optimisation Research Group](http://org.nicta.com.au), with the help of the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au) and [Actew-AGL](http://www.actewagl.com.au).\r\n\r\nSmartGridToolbox's simulation engine uses agent-based and discrete event simulation concepts. Research into future electricity grids requires the ability to handle a wide range of control strategies and simulation components.SmartGridToolbox aims to provide this ability through an API that emphasises flexibility and extensibility.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nDownload or checkout a copy of SmartGridToolbox from GitHub. To download the latest release, go to \r\n\r\n### Code Documentation\r\nThe primary documentation for the code is via [doxygen](doxygen_docs/index.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
