				<h3><a name="sgt-architecture" class="anchor" href="#sgt-architecture"></a>Introduction to the SmartGridToolbox Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					SmartGridToolbox is a library that can be used to rapidly develop simulations of of smart grid and microgrid systems. It is written in C++11, and users will need access to a compiler that can handle this C++ specification.
				</p>
				<h4><a name="sgt-library" class="anchor" href="#sgt-library"></a>SmartGridToolbox libraries</h4>
				<p>
					SmartGridToolbox consists of two libraries: <strong>SgtCore</strong> , which contains core utilities and powerflow modelling tools and solvers, and <strong>SgtSim</strong>, which contains the simulation architecture and simulation components. SgtCore may be used in a standalone manner, for non-simulation based tasks. SgtSim is built on top of SgtCore. In the following, we will assume that SmartGridToolbox has already been compiled and installed in the default location, <code>/usr/local</code>.
				</p>
				<h4><a name="sgt-library" class="anchor" href="#sgt-library"></a>Including and linking the SmartGridToolbox libraries</h4>
				<p>
					SmartGridToolbox programs will need to link to the SmartGridToolbox libraries, and will need to include the relevant SmartGridToolbox header files.
				</p>
				<p>
					Header files may be included individually, as follows, e.g.:
<pre><code>#include &ltSgtCore/Network.h&gt
#include &ltSgtSim/Simulation.h&gt
</code></pre>
					or they may be all included automatically using 
<pre><code>#include &ltSgtCore.h&gt
#include &ltSgtSim.h&gt
</code></pre>
				</p>
				<p>
					SmartGridToolbox uses the GNU autotools build system, and builds libraries using libtool. By default, static libraries only are built; for dynamic libraries, SmartGridToolbox should be <code>configure</code>d with the <code>--enable-shared</code> option.
				</p>
				<p>
					The easiest cross-platform way to link to your application is to also use libtool with the GNU autotools. <code>SmartGridToolbox/examples/ResidentialA/Makefile.am</code> gives an example of how to do this. Libtool handles all library dependencies, and correctly handles shared libraries in a manner that is appropriate for the architecture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Otherwise, you must choose	the correct static and dynamic libraries. To statically link a program, the following link flags will work: <code>-lSgtCore -lSgtSim -larmadillo -lboost_date_time -lyaml-cpp</code>. If your program is using <code>SgtCore</code> only, then obviously the <code>-lSgtSim</code> flag should be omitted.
				</p>
				<h4><a name="sgt-utsl" class="anchor" href="#sgt-utsl"></a>Use the Source, Luke</h4>
				<p>
					At present, the SmartGridToolbox documentation is somewhat sketchy. Users are encouraged to explore the source code, either directly, or through the <a href="doxygen_docs/index.html">doxygen documentation</a> (organised by functional modules <a href="">here</a>). Core/Non-simulation functionalities are located in the <code>SgtCore</code> subdirectory, the simulation engine and components are located in <code>SgtSim</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					
				</p>
				<h4><a name="sgt-component" class="anchor" href="#sgt-component"></a>The Component Class</h4>
				<p>
					Most objects in SmartGridToolbox models and simulations derive from the <code><a href="doxygen_docs/class_sgt_1_1_component.html">Component</a></code> class. The most important function of this class is to provide a unique key (a <code>std::string</code>) for each object. <code>Component</code>s are also able to provide a component type string, to print themselves, and to act as an access point to an objects <code>Property</code>s. 
				</p>
				<h4><a name="sgt-core" class="anchor" href="#sgt-core"></a>SgtCore: Core Functionality, Network Modelling and Power Flow</h4>
				<p>
					While SmartGridToolbox excels at dynamic simulations, it is also able to function as a stand alone library for modelling and solving power flow problems. As mentioned above, when doing this, the SgtCore library may be used on its own, without the SgtSim library.
				</p>
				<h5><a name="sgt-network" class="anchor" href="#sgt-component"></a>The Network Class and Power Flow Modelling</h5>
				</p>
					SgtCore contains many utility classes and functions, but at its core is the power flow functionality. The overarching class used in modeling power flow problems is the <code><a href="doxygen_docs/class_sgt_1_1_network.html">Network</a></code> class.
