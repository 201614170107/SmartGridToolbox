Design Notes for MGSim
----------------------

1. There are powerflow and non-powerflow aspects to this problem.

   a) powerflow
   b) heat flow
   c) control aspects
   d) climate and weather aspects
   e) building models
   f) market aspects
   g) reliability aspects
   h) optimization aspects

2. Powerflow has steady state solution and non-steady state solution. Don't
   really want to commit to either.

   a) Steady state derives from Kirchoff's circuit laws, assuming constant
      impedance for all components. Note however that the constant impedance
      is not necessarily known and might be expressed in terms of power,
      voltage etc.

   b) Non-steady state arises directly from the physics of the components
      (generators, transformers etc.).

3. Primary design consideration is need for extensibility and flexibility.
