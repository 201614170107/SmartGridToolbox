Building and Installing SmartGridToolbox
----------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites
----------------

You need a compiler that will support modern C++. The clang compiler is
recommended, although later versions of g++ (4.8, 4.9, ...) may also work.

If building on a Mac, you should have a recent version of the OSX operating
system (Mavericks and Yosemite work). Install XCode, and you will have access
to the clang compilers.

If building on Ubuntu, you should ideally have Ubuntu 13 or later installed so
as to be able to easily install a recent version of gcc (e.g. 4.8+) or clang.
You can use, e.g.
> sudo apt-get install clang++

Install up to date versions of the following libraries:

a) Boost libraries:

   boost/date_time, boost/random (header only), boost/spirit (header only).
   
   The easiest procedure is to just install the whole of boost, either by
   downloading the latest version from www.boost.org and following the build
   instructions, or by using a tool such as homebrew (Mac OSX), apt-get
   (Debian Linux distributions such as Ubuntu) or similar.  

b) Armadillo linear algebra library:

   This is available from http://arma.sourceforge.net. On a mac, you can also
   use homebrew.

b) SuiteSparse libraries:

   amd, colamd, btf, klu

   The source code for these is provided in the third_party/SuiteSparse
   directory. The build is straightforward, but Makefiles may need to be
   modified for your system. Alternatively, install using homebrew (OSX),
   apt-get (Ubuntu) or similar.

d) The yaml-cpp library:

   Source code is provided in third_party/yaml-cpp-0.5.0, or alternatively,
   install using homebrew, apt-get or the like.

3. Build and install the library:

If installing from a tarball: simply run the usual configure/make/install
procedure, using the desired options to configure (type "configure --help" for a
list).

> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install

If running from e.g. a source distribution cloned from git, you should run
autogen.sh immediately after cloning the github repository. You will need an
up to date version of gnu autotools.

4. To compile and link your program (e.g.):

> clang++ {options} -o myprogram myprogram.cc -lSgtCore -lSgtSim
