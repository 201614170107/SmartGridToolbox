Building and Installing SmartGridToolbox
----------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites
----------------

SmartGridToolbox programs will need to be linked with various libraries, and
will also be required to have access to   

Install up to date versions of the following libraries:

a) Boost libraries:

   boost/date_time, boost/numeric/ublas (header only), 
   boost/random (header only), boost/spirit (header only)

   The easiest procedure is to just install the whole of boost, either by
   downloading the latest version from www.boost.org and following the build
   instructions, or by using a tool such as homebrew (Mac OSX), apt-get
   (Debian Linux distributions such as Ubuntu) or similar.  

b) SuiteSparse libraries:

   amd, colamd, btf, klu

   The source code for these is provided in the third_party/SuiteSparse
   directory. The build is straightforward, but Makefiles may need to be
   modified for your system. Alternatively, install using homebrew (OSX),
   apt-get (Ubuntu) or similar.

c) The blas library:

   The easiest procedure is to use homebrew (OSX), apt-get (Ubuntu) or similar.

d) The yaml-cpp library:

   Source code is provided in third_party/yaml-cpp-0.5.0, or alternatively,
   install using homebrew, apt-get or the like.

2. If building on a Mac, make sure xcode is installed. If building under Linux,
   make sure a recent version of g++ (v. 4.7 or higher), or a compiler that
   supports C++-11, is used.

3. Build and install the library:

If installing from a tarball: simply run the usual configure/make/install
procedure, using the desired options to configure (type "configure --help" for a
list).

> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install

When building on a Mac using the system supplied (LLVM) version of g++, you will
need to specify the "-ftemplate-depth=160" compiler flag, e.g.

./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O2 -ftemplate-depth=160'

If running from e.g. a source distribution cloned from git, you should first
run autogen.sh. You will need an up to date version of gnu autotools.

4. To compile and link your program:

> g++ {options} -o myprogram myprogram.cc \
  -lSmartGridToolbox -lboost_date_time-mt -lblas -lyaml-cpp -lklu -lamd \
  -lcolamd -lbtf
