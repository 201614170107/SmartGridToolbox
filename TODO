Powerflow testing:
------------------

When solve_powerflow is run, some matpower cases differ from matpower itself.
One particular example is case57 - for which even the reactive power of the
slack bus differs from Matpower.

TODO: The plan is to output both matpower and my solver and feed them into an
independent octave verification of the powerflow equations, thereby seeing
where things are going wrong.

Note also that the "prior_to_armadillo" tag has a different result again - but
this is clearly wrong as the generator power is actually the generator power
plus the zip power. If the zip power is subtracted off, the result in HEAD is
recovered. TODO: create a branch at this tag, and fix the problem - so that we
have a working ublas version available.

Note also that the voltages and zips appear to be correct and agreeing in all
versions.

UPDATE:

This is in progress, and an issue has been identified where if there is a
single generator on a PV (or presumably slack) bus, and the generator is out of
service, then the bus should be treated as a PQ bus but isn't.

Need to think about how best to handle this. Thoughs:

1. Bus type really belongs to the "node", which knows about generators.
2. Just silently handle this when constructing the PowerFlow problem.

Parser issue:
-------------
In Parser.cc, make math work on things other than integers.

Documentation (gh-pages):
-------------------------
The gh-pages documentation is out of date.

Doxygen API documentation:
--------------------------
This is out of date, e.g. wrt. modules etc.
