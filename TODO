Parser issue:
-------------
In Parser.cc, make math work on things other than integers.

UPDATE: this is currently low priority.

Documentation (gh-pages):
-------------------------
The gh-pages documentation is out of date.

Doxygen API documentation:
--------------------------
This is out of date, e.g. wrt. modules etc.

Simulation Architecture:
------------------------
It would be better if objects didn't store pointers to each other - instead,
they stored iterators into the component map or alternatively pointers to the
smart pointer in the map. I think an iterator into the map is the best idea.

The idea here is that we can set up references etc. during the first pass of
parsing without needing to use a particular evalutation order, and we can
replace components etc.

Also, this will help in serialization. Really, we should serialize component
relationships using the names.

Serialization:
--------------
Write a Component::Serialize virtual member function, and implement for all
components. ComponentState is the serialized object, a series of bytes.
Could use the boost library.

Write the architecture for an entire simulation to be serialized and restored.
In particular, this means that components should have a very controlled view of
each other, as discussed above, e.g. using map iterators or reference_wrapper
to smart pointers, etc.

Time:
-----
Make change so that all times stored in the Simulation should be considered to
be local times rather than UTC times. Thus we need to explicitly convert to UTC 
in code (e.g. Sun) that requires it.

The point of this change is to make a more direct connection with parsed files
etc. i.e. don't have to convert parsed times to UTC to match with Simulation
times.

State:
------
Components should normally store a structure called State, and they should store
their initial state so that they can be reset. State should also ideally be
serializable. There are two types of member data in a component: configuration,
and state.

PowerTools:
-----------
There is duplicated sgt2PowerTools / smartGridToolbox2PowerTools code between
SGT and PT. Need to be careful about dependencies, but could do something about
this.

Casting:
--------
dynamic_pointer_casts are annoying, write a decent casting function.

Indentation of YAML files
-------------------------
Still need to fix e.g. '-  bus' to either '-   bus' or '- bus'. Latter is good.

Parser:
-------
Need more info on what we're parsing.
