Release Notes for SmartGridToolbox v3.0.0
-----------------------------------------
Release 3.0.0 sees major breaking changes to the SmartGridToolbox API. We do
not anticipate many more changes like this, but have decided to take the
opportunity to make these changes fairly early on. Most notably, the use of
shared_ptr has been quarantined to objects (Network, Simulation) that actually
posess true ownership of components. In conjunction with this change, many
functions now use pass by reference, rather than the previous pass by (shared)
pointer. These changes result in a cleaner, more easily understood design that
is just as safe.
